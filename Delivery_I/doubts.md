# Doubts

- Donation.data in validation checking, can it be used? 
- ID variable??
- Stupidity in constraints: should values like donation.value be > 0 in a constraint or capacity >0?
- Should calculated variables have a constraint, nohoursworked >0?
- Needy attributes 
- Support requests
- Medical Staff
- Maximum capacity in shelter
- Help priority status as needy attribute 
- Support request, needy and support- triple???
- Number of people a advisor can guide < 10 at the same time, define it as constraint??
- What should the name of relations describe (are the classes' names self explanatory)
- Post-its explaining the subtexts of the classes

# Possible additions
- Advisor has to approve a given project (association? Attribute??)
