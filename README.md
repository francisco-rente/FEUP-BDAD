## Short description 

We intend to model the operation of a charity organization.

The organization has personnel (volunteers and hired staff) spread across different areas (planning, distribution, etc.) to ensure the necessary support to various groups (children, elderly...).

For each staff member, it is important to know their work schedule and contact information.

The support provided can be of different types (essential goods, monetary...) and will have an associated start date and the responsible staff member.

It is important to store the address and contact information of each beneficiary and the support they are entitled to (for how long).

The operation of the institution is ensured through donations (monetary or goods...) and government funds. Additionally, the institution is responsible for all contacts with suppliers.
